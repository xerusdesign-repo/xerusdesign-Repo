Every icon in this theme has greatly improved the stock design whilst still keeping it familiar. The colour palette that is featured with Felicity is also improving the current design by making all colours and gradients brighter and easier on the eye. \r\nFelicity is meant to be, and I\u2019m sure you will love it! \r\nAs before mentioned, Felicity comes with 200+ icons and many more well on the way. Felicity supports iOS 7-11 and features iOS 11 styled Cydia, AppStore and iTunes icons for that iOS 11 look! Many more features and icons are coming in future updates so stay tuned!\r\nYou can request icons via my twitter @xerusdesign \r\nRequires Snowboard or Anemone.",
